You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

 

Example 1:

Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
Example 2:

Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10 
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
Example 3:

Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
 

Constraints:

m == accounts.length
n == accounts[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100

SOLUTION :
//Program to find the richest cutomer wealth
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int row,col;
    printf("Enter the row size :");
    scanf("%d",&row);
    printf("Enter the column size: ");
    scanf("%d",&col);
    int arr[row][col];
    int i,j,sum=0;
    int result;
    printf("Enter the array elements :");
    for(i=0;i<row;i++){
        for(j=0;j<col;j++){
            scanf("%d",&arr[i][j]);
        }
    }
    printf("The array elements are :");
    for(i=0;i<row;i++){
        for(j=0;j<col;j++){
            printf("%d ",arr[i][j]);
        }
    }
    for(i=0;i<row;i++){
        for(j=0;j<col;j++)
        {
            sum+=arr[i][j];
        }
        if(sum>result)
        {
            result=sum;
        }
        sum=0;
    }
    printf("\n");
    printf("Richest customer wealth is %d",result);
    
OUTPUT :

Enter the row size :3
Enter the column size: 3
Enter the array elements :2 8 7 7 1 3 1 9 5
The array elements are :2 8 7 7 1 3 1 9 5 
Richest customer wealth is 17
